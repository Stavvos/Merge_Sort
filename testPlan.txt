Objective

To observe what happens when the program's array characters/numbers are changed. 

Scope 

The features to be tested are the sorting functions merge and mergeSort. 
Not the print function. However the print function will be used to display results. 

Test Acceptance Criteria 

The program will be considered accepted if it passes 
the the test cases T1, T2, and T4. 

Entry/Exit criteria 

Testing starts at the test case T1, and ends once the test case T4 is completed. 

Test Schedule

T1 completed in 5 minutes. 
T2 completed in 5 minutes.
T3 completed in 5 minutes. 
T4 completed in 5 minutes. 

Test Strategy

Testing will be conducted manually. 

Resources

One person required for testing. Time required is 30 minutes.
Will need an interactive development environment (IDE) that supports
C++. 

Test Environment 

Codeblocks IDE

Test Cases

T1 = Check if program can sort an array of positive numbers 
in ascending order. 
T2 = Check if program can sort an array of negative numbers
in ascending order. 
T3 = Check if program can sort an array of roman alphabet symbols
in ascending order. 
T4 = Check if program can sort an array with positive numbers and
a zero. 

Assumptions 

T1, T2, T3, and T4 are going to provide actual results equal
to expected results as per the test case document.
